#Studio 10  
##Versioning/ Github  

**Model 1:**  

- 3 collaborators push/pull from remote 
- permission granted to those 3 to write into repository  
- works great for very small teams, almost same model as google docs  

**Model 2:**  

- model 1 doesn't really work with thousands of lines of code and many people editing due to version loss  
- at some point you can branch the versions  
- branch remote versions, each user has their own remote and local versions  
- local users create changes then submit "pull requests" and other users accept or deny changes after review
